# OwnedCooky

Hi there, my name is OwnedCooky! You can use me to give someone ingredients and cookies to add happiness to their day.

## Description

### Here's how I work

1. Everyone receives ingredients to give out periodically.
2. To give someone an ingredient: **@username :ingredientname:**
3. Bake a cookie when you receive enough ingredients: **/cookies-bake :cookietype:**
4. To give someone a cookie you baked: **@username :cookietype:**

### Here are a few helpful commands

1. **/cookie-inventory** List owned cookie ingredients and cookies
2. **/cookies-bakeable-list** Lists all cookie recipes able to be created with current ingredients
